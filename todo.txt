* Bugs
  - When service endpoints do not specify a serializer but the service
    does, it should use the serializer defined by the service

* Missing MVP features
  - Service endpoints need to be able to return a future (Task<T>)
    and have the T serialized to the response only after the task completes

* Future features
  - Support for multiple instances of pages middleware on 
    different Owin routes and possibly with different fluent
    builder configurations.
  - For service endpoints the RequiredPermission attribute asset path
    should be able to contain placeholders for parameter values. For
	example "/user/{userid}" where {userid} is replaced with the value
	of the userid parameter passed to the method.
  - Localization database and management UI
  
* Refactoring
  - Depreciate some properties of RepeatAttribute because there are
    other attributes that provide the same features

* Forms
  - Routing POST requests to component that rendered the form tag
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get
   
* Template parsers
  - Html with custom tags for data binding and repeating
  - Angular subset

* Standard packages
  - Commonly used layouts
  - Tab bar
  - Collapsible sections
  - Accordion
  - Forms authentication and account management
