# Sample 1

This sample website is used for testing an debugging the implementation of the Pages Framework.

Please do not use this as an example of how to build a website, it contains many permutations of 
what is possible to facilitate testing those scenarios, and might be useful for you in understanding
the scope of possibilities, but is not useful as an example to follow in your own website.
