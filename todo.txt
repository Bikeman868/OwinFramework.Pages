* Bugs
  - No support for multiple instances of pages middleware on different Owin routes
  
* Forms
  - Routing POST requests to component that rendered the form tag
  - Re-rendering the page after POST
   
* Template classes
  - Define a style and content file that is specific to the template - like Angular
  - Files deployed with the application and loaded at startup
  - Css supports usual deployment options - packages, global or in-page
  - Html parser for the content defined by the template class

  [IsTemplate("/templates/product")]
  [TemplateStyle("~/assets/template/product/product-component.css")]
  [TemplateContent("~/assets/template/product/product-component.md")]
  [TemplateParser("markdown-with-mustache")]
  [NeedsData(typeof(Product))]
  public class MyTemplate { }

* Template parsers
  - Html with custom tags for data binding and repeating
  - Angular subset

* Standard packages
  - Commonly used layouts
  - Tab bar
  - Collapsible sections
  - Accordion
  - Forms authentication and account management

* REST Services
  - Add analytics to service endpoints
  - Implementing ISelfDocumenting for REST services
