Wrap components in database records to add descriptions and expose properties that can be configured.

When components are set into regions allow the component name including package specifier, or the
component ID to be specified. When using a component ID allow a set of property values to be specified.
In this case an instance of the component should be constructed with the specified property values. This
is similar to the Kentico Webpart concept.

Define a change notification mechanism and an implementation that uses the audit log in the database to
apply changes that were made in other web servers in the farm.

Build another runtime package that is not static - i.e. it receives change notifications and dynamically
adjusts the pages, regions and layouts.

Build a mechanism to switch the website to a different version of the website whilst it is running and
with no downtime.

Build an editor SPA in Vue.
- Layout regions should be called "Zones" to avoid confusion with region elements.
