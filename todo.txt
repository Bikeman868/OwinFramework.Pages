* Bugs
 - When parsing markdown with blocks of source code the special characters in the
   source code need to be turned into html entities.
   
* Template classes
  - Define a style and content file that is specific to the template - like Angular
  - Files deployed with the application and loaded at startup
  - Css supports usual deployment options - packages, global or in-page
  - Html parser for the content defined by the template class

  [IsTemplate("/templates/product")]
  [TemplateStyle("~/assets/template/product/product-component.css")]
  [TemplateContent("~/assets/template/product/product-component.md")]
  [TemplateParser("markdown-with-mustache")]
  [NeedsData(typeof(Product))]
  public class MyTemplate { }

* Template parsers
  - Html with custom tags for data binding and repeating
  - Html with mustache
  - Angular subset

* Standard packages
  - Commonly used layouts
  - Tab bar
  - Collapsible sections
  - Accordion
  - Forms authentication

* REST Services
